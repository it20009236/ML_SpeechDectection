Hate Speech: Speech targeting groups based on race, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, or gender identity, aiming to demean, threaten, or incite hatred. It fuels discrimination, isolates individuals, and can escalate to violence or societal division. Addressing it is critical to fostering safety and inclusivity.
